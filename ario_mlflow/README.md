# ario-mlflow

Verifiable provenance for the MLflow lifecycle — training, registration, promotion, inference.
Signed cryptographic proofs are anchored to Arweave via ar.io, so an auditor can verify a model
or decision long after your MLflow server is gone.

> **Status.** Early-shape idea, not a production-ready system. Default behaviors
> prioritize frictionless evaluation over production hardening. See `ROADMAP.md`
> at repo root for what's next.

## Install

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Python 3.10+. Installs MLflow (≥ 2.14), PyNaCl, and the ar.io Turbo SDK.

## Quickstart

```python
import mlflow
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
import ario_mlflow

X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)

with mlflow.start_run():
    model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=200).fit(X, y)
    mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", model.score(X, y))
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")

    # Signs a proof, hashes the logged artifacts, writes ario.* tags,
    # and (if anchoring is enabled) uploads to Arweave.
    result = ario_mlflow.anchor()
    print(result["tags"]["ario.training_tx"])
```

No wallet configured? The plugin auto-generates one on first run and persists it
to `~/.ario-mlflow/wallet.json` so your signing address stays stable across
sessions. Set `ARIO_MLFLOW_ARWEAVE_WALLET=/path/to/wallet.json` to use your own.

A full runnable example lives in `examples/sklearn-quickstart/`.

## The three integration points

### 1. `ario_mlflow.anchor()` — training provenance

Call inside an active `mlflow.start_run()` after logging your model. The plugin
auto-resolves the logged model's `artifact_path` from MLflow's log-model history,
so you rarely need to pass it explicitly.

Returns a dict with `proof`, `anchor_result`, `tags`, `artifact_path`,
`artifact_status` (`"hashed"` / `"no_artifacts"` / `"hash_failed"`), and
`artifact_error`.

### 2. `ario_mlflow.ArioMlflowClient` — registration + promotion

A drop-in replacement for `mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient`. Registration and stage
promotions are anchored automatically in a background thread. Query the outcome
via the client:

```python
from ario_mlflow import ArioMlflowClient

client = ArioMlflowClient()
mv = client.create_model_version("credit-scorer", "runs:/<run_id>/model")

# Block until the async anchor finishes (optional):
client.wait_for_anchor("registration", "credit-scorer", mv.version, timeout=30)

status = client.anchor_status("registration", "credit-scorer", mv.version)
# {"status": "anchored", "tx_id": "...", "error": None, "done": True}
```

### 3. `ario_mlflow.VerifiedModel` — inference

Wraps a registered model with an integrity check that runs **before** the
underlying pyfunc model is loaded (so a tampered artifact never gets a chance
to execute user code):

```python
from ario_mlflow import VerifiedModel

vm = VerifiedModel("models:/credit-scorer/1")  # raises IntegrityError on hash mismatch
# Features, in order: annual_income, credit_utilization, debt_to_income_ratio,
# months_employed, credit_score.
result = vm.predict([78000, 0.18, 0.22, 72, 745])
print(result.decision_id, result.proof_status)  # "anchoring" → "anchored"

# Wait for the background anchor if you want the TX synchronously:
result.wait_for_anchor(timeout=10)
print(result.tx_id, result.anchor_error)
```

## Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `ARIO_MLFLOW_ARWEAVE_WALLET` | Path to an Arweave JWK wallet file | auto-generates + persists at `~/.ario-mlflow/wallet.json` |
| `ARIO_MLFLOW_GATEWAY_HOST` | ar.io gateway for uploads & fetches | `turbo-gateway.com` |
| `ARIO_MLFLOW_SIGNING_KEY` | Base64-encoded Ed25519 seed | auto-generates at `~/.ario-mlflow/keys/` |
| `ARIO_MLFLOW_ARIO_VERIFY_URL` | ar.io Verify REST API base URL | ar.io attestation disabled if unset |

## Tags the plugin writes

On the training run (`anchor()`):

- `ario.enabled`, `ario.version` — via the registered `RunContextProvider`
- `ario.public_key`, `ario.verify_status`, `ario.artifact_hash`
- `ario.payload_hash` — SHA-256 of the canonical payload bytes (the same hash committed in the envelope)
- `ario.training_tx`, `ario.arweave_url` — when the Arweave upload succeeded
- `ario.wallet_mode` — `user-configured` / `persistent` / `ephemeral`

On the registered model (chain head, written by `anchor()`):

- `ario.last_training_hash` — pointer to the most recent training proof for this registered model; the next training reads it to set its `previous_hash`

On model versions (`ArioMlflowClient`):

- `ario.artifact_verified` — `true` / `false` from re-hashing at registration
- `ario.registration_tx`, `ario.promotion_tx`, `ario.arweave_url`

After running `ario-mlflow verify …` (training run or model version):

- `ario.verify_status` → `verified`
- `ario.attestation_level` — `1`, `2`, or `3` (see levels section below)
- `ario.report_url` — link to the ar.io Verify dashboard for this proof
- `ario.attested_by`, `ario.attested_at` — gateway operator and timestamp,
  only present when the operator has configured a signing wallet

On `@mlflow.trace` spans emitted by `VerifiedModel.predict()`:

- `ario.payload_json` — the full canonical payload (mirror of the
  `ario/predictions/<id>/payload.json` artifact). Read by `verify_source_of_truth`
  as the second MLflow surface for prediction check 3.
- `ario.decision_id`, `ario.model_name`, `ario.model_version`
- `ario.input_hash`, `ario.output_hash`, `ario.payload_hash`
- `ario.proof_status`, `ario.prediction_tx`, `ario.arweave_url`
- `ario.artifact_verified` (when known)

## CLI

```bash
ario-mlflow verify run <run_id>                  # verify training proof
ario-mlflow verify model <name>/<version>        # verify registration proof
ario-mlflow verify trace <trace_id>              # verify an inference proof
ario-mlflow audit <name>/<version>               # full model-lineage audit
```

All `verify` commands run the full four-check flow:

1. **Signature** — Ed25519 signature on the on-chain envelope is valid.
2. **Anchored bytes intact** — download `ario/payload.json` from MLflow,
   re-hash, compare to envelope's `payload_hash`.
3. **Source of truth matches** — re-derive canonical bytes from a *separate*
   live MLflow surface and compare to the anchored payload. This is the
   tamper-detection check.
   - `verify run` re-fetches `run.data.params/metrics/artifact_checksums`.
   - `verify model` re-derives the artifact-verified state from the source run.
   - `verify trace` re-fetches the `ario.payload_json` trace tag (mirrored
     by `VerifiedModel.predict` at write time) and compares to the artifact.
4. **ar.io Verify attestation** — independent third-party check (if
   `ARIO_MLFLOW_ARIO_VERIFY_URL` is set).

Predictions, training, and registration all run all four checks — feature
equivalent verification. If a prediction's MLflow trace has been pruned by
a retention policy, check 3 surfaces as `ok=False, reason=live_refetch_incomplete`
so an auditor sees a clear "trace not available" rather than a silent pass.
The proof itself (signature + anchored bytes + ar.io) is unaffected by trace
retention — those rely only on permanent storage (Arweave + MLflow artifact store).

Results are written back to the MLflow tags and the HTML report is regenerated.

## What the attestation levels actually mean

`ario-mlflow verify` reports an ar.io attestation level. The levels describe
**how much of the proof has been independently verified**, not network-
confirmation depth:

- **Level 1 — Finalized on Arweave.** The proof was found in a confirmed block
  on the Arweave network at a specific block height and timestamp. On Arweave,
  a confirmed block means permanent storage.
- **Level 2 — Content integrity confirmed.** ar.io re-downloaded the raw proof
  and recomputed its SHA-256 fingerprint. The bytes match the gateway's digest.
  Cryptographic signature verification still pending.
- **Level 3 — Cryptographically verified.** The digital signature on the proof
  has been independently verified against the original signer's public key.
  This is a mathematical proof, not a trust claim.

**Operator attestation.** When an ar.io gateway operator has configured a
signing wallet, the verification result is itself signed with that operator's
wallet and `ario.attested_by` / `ario.attested_at` are written back to your
MLflow tags. This is an independent statement from a known ar.io operator that
they personally verified the proof — separate from and additional to the level
above. The operator signature is standard RSA-PSS SHA-256 over canonical JSON,
so any third party can verify it with the operator's public key.

These levels and attestations cover integrity and authenticity of the anchored
record. Semantic verification (whether this model produced this decision on
this input) is on the roadmap, not in v0.1.
