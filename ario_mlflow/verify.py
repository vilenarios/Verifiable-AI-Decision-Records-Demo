"""Four-check verification helpers for the pure-commitment design.

The four checks (see plan Part 3 verification flow):

1. **Cryptographic signature.** Validate Ed25519 signature on the
   envelope. Local, instant.
2. **Anchored bytes intact.** Download ``ario/payload.json`` from MLflow,
   re-hash, compare to the envelope's ``payload_hash``. Catches
   tampering with the canonical witness in MLflow's artifact store.
3. **Live MLflow matches anchored bytes.** Re-fetch the "live" fields
   (params, metrics, artifact checksums) from MLflow and rebuild the
   canonical payload, holding "snapshot" fields (caller metadata,
   trace IDs) constant from the original. Compare bytes. Catches
   tampering with MLflow's tracking-store data after anchoring.
4. **(Optional) ar.io Verify Level 3 attestation.** Independent
   third-party confirmation that the Arweave TX exists and is
   permanently stored. Implemented by ``ArioVerifyClient`` — unchanged
   from v1.

Verifiers wanting only signature + envelope-internal consistency can
call :func:`verify_signature` alone. Auditors with MLflow access run
:func:`full_verify` to get all four. The legacy three-level helpers
(``verify_record``, ``verify_arweave``, ``verify_ario``,
``full_verify`` in their v1 form) are deleted in this redesign — they
covered a different design where the proof carried the source data.

    ``mlflow_client.get_trace(trace_id)`` — additionally loads the
    trace's spans from its artifact repository, which on MLflow 3.x
    requires ``mlflow.artifactLocation`` to be present in the trace's
    tags. Some MLflow 3.x backend modes don't set that tag, and the
    spans-load step then raises ``Unable to determine trace artifact
    location`` — even though our caller never touches the spans.

    This helper prefers the lighter ``_tracing_client.get_trace_info``
    path (returns a ``TraceInfo`` with tags, no spans → no artifact

# - Level 2: at least one gateway has downloaded and validated the

# tooling that runs immediately after anchor can pass 1 to accept

# Note on deleted v1 helpers: the legacy three-level helpers
# (verify_record / verify_arweave / verify_ario / legacy full_verify)
# lived at the bottom of this module in v1. They covered the v1
# envelope shape where source data was inside the proof itself; the
# pure-commitment design needs different checks (download payload.json,
# compare hash, re-derive from MLflow). The new helpers near the top
# of this file (verify_signature / verify_anchored_bytes /
# verify_source_of_truth / verify_ario_attestation / new full_verify)
# are the replacements. CLI consumers updated in Phase 1.9.
