    Phase 2.A migration: instead of using ``mlflow.sklearn.log_model(...,
    registered_model_name=...)`` (which auto-registers but doesn't anchor)
    + manual proof creation, this function now:

    1. Logs the model under the run *without* auto-registration, so we
       can use ``ArioMlflowClient.create_model_version`` for the
       registration step.
    2. Calls ``ario_mlflow.anchor()`` inside the run — produces the
       pure-commitment training proof, writes ``ario/payload.json``,
       sets ``ario.training_tx`` / ``ario.payload_hash`` on the run.
    3. Calls ``ArioMlflowClient.create_model_version()`` after the run
       closes — auto-anchors the registration proof in a daemon thread,
       chained to the training's ``ario.training_tx``.

    Args:
        tracking_uri: MLflow tracking URI.
        model_name: Registered model name to use.
        proof_engine: Optional override. When ``None``, ``anchor()`` and
            ``ArioMlflowClient`` create their own.
        arweave: Optional override. Same semantics.
        max_iter: Logistic regression max iterations.
        random_state: Seed for data + classifier.

    Returns:
        Dict with ``run_id``, ``model_name``, ``model_version``,
        ``artifact_uri``, ``accuracy``, plus the new
        ``training_envelope``, ``training_payload_hash``,
        ``training_anchor_result`` from the plugin's anchor() so the
