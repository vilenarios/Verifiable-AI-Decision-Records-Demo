# Verifiable AI Decision Records

Tamper-evident AI audit trail anchored to Arweave, covering the full MLflow lifecycle.

## What This Demonstrates

This project provides **verifiable provenance for the entire ML lifecycle** — from training through to production predictions. Every lifecycle event creates a signed proof record anchored to Arweave via ar.io:

1. **Training provenance** — params, metrics, and artifact hashes are captured and anchored when a model is trained
2. **Registration provenance** — model registration events are signed and anchored with a link back to the training proof
3. **Prediction records** — every inference creates a decision record with full model lineage
4. **Chain of custody** — an unbroken, verifiable chain from training → registration → predictions

Each record is:

- **Traced** — OpenTelemetry captures runtime context (trace ID, span ID)
- **Linked to model lineage** — MLflow records which model version produced the output
- **Hashed & signed** — SHA-256 hash chain + Ed25519 digital signature
- **Anchored to Arweave** — Immutable permanent storage via ar.io Turbo
- **Independently verifiable** — ar.io Verify produces on-demand attestations

If someone tampers with a local record, the **Arweave-anchored copy** remains intact and verifiable.

## Architecture

```
Startup (background thread)
  |---> MLflow: read training run (params, metrics, artifact checksums)
  |---> Build training proof → sign → anchor to Arweave
  |---> MLflow: read model registration metadata
  |---> Build registration proof → sign → anchor to Arweave
  |---> Chain: training TX → registration TX

User Input

Arweave: proof only (record, hash, chain link, signature, public key)

  ... later, on demand ...

/verify endpoint

```

### Async Anchoring

Predictions return instantly (~4ms). Arweave uploads happen in a background thread and typically complete within 1-2 seconds. The UI auto-polls and updates when the TX ID arrives.

### What Gets Anchored

Small JSON proof records (~1-5 KB each) — not model binaries. Each contains:

```json
{
  "record": { "event_type": "...", "model_name": "...", ... },
  "record_hash": "SHA-256 of canonical JSON",
  "previous_hash": "prior record's hash (or GENESIS)",
  "signature": "Ed25519 signature",
  "public_key": "Ed25519 public key"
}
```

### The Evidence Chain

Each event creates multiple layers of evidence from independent parties:

1. **Proof** (Ed25519 signature) — the AI system attests to the event
2. **Turbo receipt** (Turbo's signature + ms timestamp) — independent service attests when the proof was submitted
3. **Arweave block** — network consensus confirms permanent storage
4. **ar.io Verify** (on-demand, gateway operator's signature) — independent verification of the anchored data

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train the Model (optional — auto-trains on first prediction)

```bash
python scripts/train_model.py
```

### 3. Start the App

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

### 4. Open the Dashboard

Navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## Arweave Setup (Optional)

To enable permanent anchoring:

1. Generate an Arweave wallet at [arweave.app](https://arweave.app)
2. Save the wallet JSON as `keys/arweave_wallet.json`
3. Fund with credits via [ardrive.io](https://ardrive.io)

Without a wallet, the app runs in **local proof mode** — hashing, signing, and verification all work locally.

## Demo Walkthrough

### 1. View the Chain of Custody

On startup, training and registration proofs are automatically anchored. Click **Model Lineage** in the navigation to see the chain: Training Run → Model Registration → Predictions.

### 2. Make a Prediction

Submit the form with iris flower measurements. The response is instant — the detail page shows "Anchoring..." with a pulsing indicator, then auto-updates when the Arweave upload completes (~1-2s).

### 3. View the Decision Record

Click a decision ID to see the full record:
- **Prediction** — class, probabilities with visual bars, features used
- **ar.io Verification** — three-level verification status (hash, signature, permanent copy, attestation)
- **Model lineage** — MLflow run ID, version, artifact URI, with link to chain of custody
- **Proof layer** — record hash, chain link, Ed25519 signature
- **Arweave anchoring** — transaction ID, status (Anchoring → Anchored → Confirmed → Permanent)
- **Turbo upload receipt** — millisecond timestamp, wallet owner, signed receipt

### 4. Verify a Record

Click **Verify with ar.io** to run on-demand verification:
- **Local** — re-hashes the record and checks the Ed25519 signature
- **Arweave** — fetches the proof from an ar.io gateway and compares hashes
- **ar.io Verify** — requests an independent attestation from the ar.io gateway operator

### 5. Train and Activate Models

Click **Train** to retrain the model — the app automatically switches to the new version. Visit the **Model Registry** to see all versions and activate any previous version with the **Activate** button. The dashboard's version filter lets you compare predictions across model versions.

### 6. Tamper with a Record

Click **Tamper** to modify the local record's output hash, then **Verify with ar.io** — local verification FAILS but the Arweave copy is still intact, proving the local record was modified after anchoring.

## MLflow Plugin (`ario-mlflow`)

The `ario_mlflow/` package is a standalone MLflow plugin that any MLflow user can adopt. It provides the same verifiable provenance as the demo, integrated into the native MLflow workflow.

### Install

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Usage

**Data Scientist — zero code changes:**

```python
import mlflow
import ario_mlflow  # Importing activates the RunContextProvider

with mlflow.start_run():
    mlflow.log_param("lr", 0.01)
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")
    mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", 0.95)
# Run ends → proof auto-anchored → TX ID written as ario.training_tx tag
```

**ML Engineer — one import swap:**

```python
from ario_mlflow import ArioMlflowClient

client = ArioMlflowClient()
client.create_model_version("fraud-detector", source=uri, run_id=run_id)
# → Anchors registration proof, writes ario.registration_tx tag

client.transition_model_version_stage("fraud-detector", "1", "Production")
# → Anchors promotion proof, writes ario.promotion_tx tag
```

**Inference:**

```python
from ario_mlflow import VerifiedModel

model = VerifiedModel("models:/fraud-detector/Production")
result = model.predict({"feature1": 1.0, "feature2": 2.0})
# result.prediction   — immediate
# result.decision_id  — immediate
# result.proof_status — "anchoring" → "anchored"
```

**Compliance / Audit — CLI:**

```bash
# Verify a training run
ario-mlflow verify run <run_id>

# Verify a model registration
ario-mlflow verify model fraud-detector/3

# Full chain of custody audit
ario-mlflow audit fraud-detector/3
```

### Plugin configuration

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ARIO_MLFLOW_ARWEAVE_WALLET` | Yes | Path to Arweave JWK wallet |
| `ARIO_MLFLOW_SIGNING_KEY` | No | Base64 Ed25519 seed (auto-generated if not set) |
| `ARIO_MLFLOW_GATEWAY_HOST` | No | ar.io gateway (default: `turbo-gateway.com`) |
| `ARIO_MLFLOW_ARIO_VERIFY_URL` | No | ar.io Verify URL |

### MLflow UI integration

The plugin writes tags visible in MLflow's native UI:

- `ario.training_tx` — Arweave TX ID for training proof
- `ario.registration_tx` — TX ID for registration proof
- `ario.promotion_tx` — TX ID for promotion proof
- `ario.artifact_hash` — SHA-256 of model artifacts at anchor time

## How It Works

### MLflow — Model Lineage
Every prediction is tied to a specific model version. MLflow captures the run ID, model version, and artifact URI, creating an auditable link between the model and its decisions.

### OpenTelemetry — Runtime Trace
Each prediction creates a distributed trace. The trace ID and span ID are embedded in the decision record, allowing correlation with infrastructure monitoring.

### Proof Layer — Integrity
Decision records are serialized to deterministic canonical JSON (sorted keys, compact separators, floats normalized to 6 decimal places), then:
- **SHA-256 hashed** — any change to the record changes the hash
- **Hash-chained** — each record links to the previous record's hash
- **Ed25519 signed** — cryptographic proof of record origin

### ar.io Turbo — Anchoring
The proof is uploaded to Arweave permanent storage via ar.io Turbo. The upload returns a signed receipt with a millisecond-precision timestamp — an independent attestation of when the proof was submitted. Once confirmed on Arweave, the data is immutable and publicly accessible.

### ar.io Verify — Independent Attestation
When verification is requested, ar.io Verify independently fetches the Arweave data, recomputes hashes, checks signatures where available, and produces a signed attestation. Verification levels:
- **Level 1** — Data found on the network, verification in progress
- **Level 2** — Data hash confirmed, signature not yet available
- **Level 3** — Digital signature verified, full authenticity confirmed

### Auditor Verification
An auditor can independently verify any proof with standard cryptographic tools:
1. Fetch the proof from Arweave using the TX ID
2. Recompute `SHA-256(canonical_json(record))` and compare to `record_hash`
3. Verify the Ed25519 signature against the `public_key`
4. Check hash chain links across records
5. No dependency on ar.io, MLflow, or any external service required
